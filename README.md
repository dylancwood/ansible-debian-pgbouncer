Ansible-Debian-PgBouncer
=========

This role installs and configures pgbouncer on Debian systems. It is tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but should work on any version for which pgbouncer is available via the default apt repositories.

Requirements
------------

none :-)

Role Variables
--------------

See `defaults/main.yml` for a complete list of variables. All vars are spelled the same as tehy are in pgbouncer.ini, and are prefixed with `pgbouncer`.
Special attention should be given to `pgbouncer_auth_users`

### pgbouncer_auth_users
This is a list of dict objects which each have a **name** and a *pass* property. You may use a plaintext or encrypted password. 
```yml
pgbouncer_auth_users:
  - name: postgres
    pass: pa55word
```
The above will result in a userlist.txt file that looks like this:
```
"postgres" "pa55word"
```

### pgbouncer_users_aliases
This is a list of dict objects wich each have a **name** and *max_user_connections* property. Allow you to configure pool connections per users.
```yml
pgbouncer_users_aliases:
  - name: backyard
    max_user_connections: 30
```

Dependencies
------------

If you are installing pgbouncer on a server other than your database server, you will also need to install **postgresql-client** if you want to query statistics. This role can do that for you if you set `pgbouner_install_pg_client` to true.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: postgres-databases
      vars:
        pgbouncer_database_aliases:
          - name: mydb
            host: 127.0.0.1
            pool_size: 50
            user: my_app
        pgbouncer_auth_users:
          - name: my_app
            pass: md52093480239932090==
        pgbouncer_install_pg_client: False
        pgbouncer_auth_type: md5
      roles:
         - { role: dylancwood.debian-pgbouncer}

I hope to combine this role with the [Redhat pgbouncer role](https://github.com/lesovsky/ansible-pgbouncer) very soon.
